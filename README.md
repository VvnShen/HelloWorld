Quandl probably could look to ingrate with other big data companies to provide more valuable and comprehensive data to the customers. This would make customers not to worry to find data sources and having Quandl as the only trusted data source. For example, Quandl is lack of realtime or delayed stock price data. If Quandl could cooperate with other companies, like Reuters, bloomberg, Nasdaq to integrate stock prices. Customers could only build API with Quandl and fetching data from one platform.

How to make the program effcient on the architecture level will have to be discussed. This is also a challenge for Quandl in order to achieve it.
